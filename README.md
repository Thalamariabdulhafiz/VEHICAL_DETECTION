This project focuses in detecting type of vehicles on indian roads and their number plates and extract the number from number plate and noted down in an xl sheet using state of the art deep learning techniques. The model is trained using yolov8 on a comprehensive dataset containg 9712 images, ensuring high accuray and performance. 

FEATURES:

  -> Detect various types of vehicles.
  
  -> Accurately identifies and locate number plates and extract the number from number plate.
  
  -> Fast and efficient real time detection using YOLOV8.
  
  
DATASET: 

  -> The model is trained on a large dataset containing 9712 images. you can access the dataset from the folowing URL :
